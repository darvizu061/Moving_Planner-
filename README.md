##### Moving Planner 

Moving planner is an online web app used to showcase general information about a certain geographic location (such as articles and images).

##### Disclaimer 

This project was initially created by udacity.com as part of their INTRO TO AJAX course online. The init files were created by udacity.com. 

The key file in use in this porject is script.js which runs the multiple api's needed in order for the app to work. I take full credit in creating the script.js file.

**The New York Times API**

Unfortunately, since this web app requires the New York Times Article Search API to load various articles, you will need to register for an API key at http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/reference/keys .

After you obtain a key, go into js/script.js. Go to line 23, copy and paste your key into the `var nyApiKey`, save file and you should be good to go.
